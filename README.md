# VoxelCraft
Created a simple Minecraft clone to explain how voxels work in games.

This project uses Unity to break down how Minecraft works.  There are 10 scenes, starting with how a square is rendered out of triangles, 
and how to connect 6 squares to form a cube.  From there it shows how to render those cubes efficiently in a mesh only showing the sides that the user will see, 
and moves on from there to show how to use those rendered cubes to create a chunk.  At this point, use Perlin noise to create the terrain layers and add a player to the world.
